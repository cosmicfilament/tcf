# tcf - Website for The Cosmic Filament
<h4> This is a long term WIP and it might change significantly as time goes on, or not at all<h4>

<p>Creating a personal website for my domain <em>TheCosmicFilament.com</em>.
Technologies used are nodejs, express, handlebars, mongoose and mongodb.
For the front end I am using bootstrap, jquery and hacking a template I purchased
called Massive.</p>
